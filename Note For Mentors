Hey Mentors!
I Tried my level best to add the functions mentioned in the project file, but was not able to do so quiet well.
If possible, can you please guide us on how to do it with nodes concept and async functions in a session , if possible.

But I must say, I learnt a lot from this Event and will try to explore more towards this journey.
Looking forward to learn more, and try to improve myself in web Developing even more in the future.
Regards,
Kirtan M
